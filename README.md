# leetcode-interview-algorithms
Answers to problems from the Leetcode (https://leetcode.com/) interview preparation kits, written in Python3.

All of these were done under time pressure and therefore scrappy. I *highly* recommend the site, and the paid subscription features, because many of the solutions provide clear algorithmic analysis and clean code examples. 

Many of the problems don't have solutions, however, and some are of low quality, so I've collected these here in case my solutions might be helpful to someone else going through the same list. I also don't want to lose them if the site goes down. I make absolutely no guarantees that these solutions are optimal or helpful.
